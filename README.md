NST Trails & Tales (Minecraft 1.20)
============================

Never Stop Toasting Minecraft 1.20 modpack by Lolmer (a.k.a. sandalle). Just posting what I use for my family to play at home. This modpack is a kitchen sink modpack catering to my children (ages 8+) with magic (Botania and Ars Nouveou) for overcoming the world and extra bosses (Botania) , technology for automating resource gathering and processing (Mekanism and Immersive Engineering), and exploring other dimensions (RFTools Dimensions and The Abyss) and space (Ad Astra) as the primary focuses. Some experimental mods are thrown in to give them a try.

I may add/remove mods throughout the lifespan of this pack as my family's needs and wants change.
